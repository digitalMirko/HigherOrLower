# HigherOrLower
App created in Android Studio 2.1.2 and tested on a Nexus 5 Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

This app randomly generates a number between 1 and 30. Then asks you to guess what it is.

The app launches and has a simple screen showing a title "Higher or Lower in the top blue bar. 
Right below is the label "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 30". Followed below by another label "Can You Guess It?" 
Then right below is the Number Text Field where you put your guess in for the number selected. The button to submit your entry is right under and labeled "MY GUESS".

Once you click it a Toast Widget will pop up and let you know one of three results:

1. If your guess is to low, it will prompt you with "Nope try again Higher"

2. If your guess is to high, it will prompt you with "Nope try again Lower"

3. But if you guess the number, it will prompt you with "Bingo, you got it".



A Simple easy to use app to play with.
